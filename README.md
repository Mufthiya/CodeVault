This project is built to enhance the security of credit card transactions using artificial intelligence. It monitors and analyzes transaction patterns and user behavior to detect unusual activity and prevent potential fraud in real-time. By using advanced machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks, the system becomes increasingly accurate at identifying fraud as it learns from more data.

Designed for seamless integration, the solution works efficiently with existing payment systems without adding delays. It also allows users to adjust the sensitivity of fraud detection based on specific risk preferences, offering a flexible and customizable approach to security.

The project is developed using Python and leverages powerful libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow or PyTorch for machine learning, as well as Pandas and NumPy for handling and processing data. API functionality is implemented through frameworks like Flask or FastAPI, and development and testing are supported with Jupyter Notebooks.

This solution is ideal for banks, e-commerce platforms, and payment service providers who want to protect their systems with smart, AI-powered fraud detection.
